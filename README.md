Q1 - How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

A1 - Style guidelines and line documentation are everything. I tend to have a horrible short term memory, especially when my personal and work life gets busy, and this makes it difficult to remember
what I was doing in these assignments from week to week. Keeping things reable and well documented helps me remember what I was doing when I go back and read my own code.

Q2 - How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your 
approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A2 - I google things like every good software developer. Seriously, most problems and errors are more easily solved by searching your specific error on stackoverflow or something as opposed to
trying to figure out what went wrong by reading the vague course material or waiting for email responses. 

Q3 - What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A3 - Computer scientists sit in meetings, eat hot chip, and occasionally write some code.
